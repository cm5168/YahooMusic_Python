For all the Python code, place data under "RawData" folder.
Create "Data" folder to store modified data, "Result" to store result.

1.g_Hierarchy.py

	Generate hierarchy structure for a list of track items.
	(The test item hierarchy structure is already generated in Raw Dataset.)

2.g_TrainClass.py

	Generate the classification of each training entity. Label track as 1, album as 2, artist as 3, and genre as 4.
For example:
UserID|RatingCount
TrackID|Rating|1
ArtistID|Rating|3
GenreID|Rating|4
AlbumID|Rating|2

	(This Program will classify each item since the Item ID can be track, album, artist or genre.)

3.gscore_Hie.py
	
	Generate ratings for all the item in the hierarchy structure.
	
4.g_TrainMean.py

	Generate mean of each user's ratings.

	(Different user have different rating preference.)
